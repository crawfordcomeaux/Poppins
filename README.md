Poppins
=======

A personal habit, routine, and schedule manager created to help me manage several ADHD issues at once. Poppins is my nanny/governess.

Changing habits is hard. 
Over time, they become hardened neural pathways in our brains and almost literally require rewiring. 
What's more, going against our default behavior (habitual response) saps our willpower.
Poppins is an attempt to change multiple habits at once, mitigating the negative effects, rewarding successes, punish failures, and help others support my (your) efforts.
